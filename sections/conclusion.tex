\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

\paragraph{Gradual Type System Design}
\AT{How to change type system for R?}

\paragraph{Fuzzing via Existing Value Catalogue}
\AT{Expand approach to fuzzing, apply in other languages.}

\paragraph{Tooling Parameterized Over Type Systems}
\AT{Write tools that have their own notion of type, specific to the functions being analyzed.
E.g., for matrix-based packages a type system with dimensionality would be useful, but that wouldn't be useful in general.}
